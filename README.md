# LHCb

* __All data__ for checking perfomance of distinguishing muons from background is  [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P3LOsP02JzD6rVx-1KZLhTG3eT5c44kW).


* Installing dependencies: 
`pip install -r <path_to_rep_requirements.txt>`.This is file with all necessary libraries.

* 
Data after undersampling is called `data_undersampled.hdf` is a processed data from LHCb.

* 
Notebook with all learned models after undersampling is called `ROC_AUC_plotting.ipynb` .



* Py scripts are for launching different hypothesis, such as polynomial features and probability density.
